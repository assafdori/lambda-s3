## Project: Automated AWS S3 Data Transfer with Lambda and Terraform ðŸª£

### Description:
This project automates data transfer between AWS S3 buckets using AWS Lambda and Terraform. It includes Terraform scripts to provision infrastructure such as S3 buckets and Lambda functions with configurable bucket names. The Python-based Lambda function orchestrates the transfer process, ensuring seamless and efficient data movement between designated source and destination buckets. Key features include error handling, logging, and event-driven triggers using AWS S3 notifications. This project demonstrates best practices in cloud automation, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and serverless architecture on AWS.
